            "| **Energy Efficiency** | Generally less energy-efficient than EVs due to energy losses in hydrogen production, distribution, and conversion back to electricity in fuel cells. | More energy-efficient due to direct use of electricity in batteries, with fewer energy conversion losses. |\n",
